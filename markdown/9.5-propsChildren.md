title: Passing to Child 2
---

As mentioned, props are React inputs to a component that are passed from Parent to Child.

They are READ ONLY - for writing, use state.

Another property of 'props' is 'props.children', which is available on every component.

it contains the content between the opening and closing tags of a component. For example:

If in the parent comp:

```javascript
<Welcome>
  <h4>Hello world!</h4>
</Welcome>
```

then in the child comp, we can:

```jsx
console.log(this.props.children); // "Hello world!"
console.log(this.props.type); // "h4".
```

If our parent has a self-closing tag, children will be undefined. Why?

```javascript
return (
  <div>
    {this.state.counters.map(counter => (
      <Child key={counter.id} value={counter.value} />
    ))}
  </div>
);
```

This is fixed if in parent, we create opening/closing component tags`(<Child></Child>)`, and place regular tags `<h4></h4>` within these:

```javascript
return (
  <div>
    {this.state.counters.map(counter => (
      <Child key={counter.id} value={counter.value}>
        <h4> Wow </h4>
      </Child>
    ))}
  </div>
);
```

Doing this, we can go to the Child's render method and `console.log(this.props)` to see the 'props.children' property:

```javascript
props {value: 4, children: {…}}
props {value: 3, children: {…}}
props {value: 2, children: {…}}
props {value: 0, children: {…}}
```

Opening this 'children' property reveals the type and props:

```javascript
children:
  {$$typeof: Symbol(react.element),
    type: "h4",
    key: null,
    ref: null,
    props: {children: "wow"}, …}
    value:4
    key:(...)
    get key:ƒ ()
```

In the child comp, we can render this.props.children as a kind of title,
since it will print <h4> wow </h4> tag for each counter/button line:

```javascript
render() {
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        {this.props.children}
        ...counter/button lines...
    )}
```

recap:

1. in the parent's render method, we add an <h4>wow</h4> within open/close <Child> tags
2. the child has access to this new element via the this.props.children

Below, we pass the Parent's state properties to the Child
looping through the state, and assigning props within the component tag:

```javascript
<div>
  {this.state.counters.map(counter => (
    <Child key={counter.id} value={counter.value} id={counter.id} />
  ))}
</div>
```

Therefore, we get a dynamic rather than a hardcoded title passed into child:

```javascript
    return(
     <React.Fragment>
      <h4>Counter: {this.props.id}</h4>
        <span className={this.getBadgeClasses()}>
```
