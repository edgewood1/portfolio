State is an object that is private to & fully controlled by the component.

It is usually placed between the class declaration and render method:

```javascript
class Counter extends Component {
    state = {
        count: 1,
    };
    render() { ... }
```

Then, in the render method, you can refer to state via the _this_ keyword in curly braces. (In JSX, curly braces enable Javascript expressions.)

```javascript
render() {
    return (
        <React.Fragment>
            <span> {this.state.count} </span>
            <button>Increment</button>
        </React.Fragment>
    )
};
```
