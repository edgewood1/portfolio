                    <p> As a teenager, I was into fantasy novels, writing, coding, and hanging with friends, and later I began college as an engineering student before switching to literature and philosophy, both
                        of which I still have a deep affinity for. </p>

                    <p> Since then, I've taught writing and research classes at various NC colleges.  I've also studied and worked as an outdoor guide at a contemplative
                        center and as an operations manager at a wildcrafting & outdoor school.

                    <p> These days, I spend most of my time exploring software / web development.  I appreciate the way
                        this work integrates past interests while allowing for new forms of expression. </p>
                    <p> I especially enjoy learning new computer languages and technologies for the ways they inform one another, for the kinds of applications they enable, and for the forms 
                    of community and collaboration that they can foster. </p>
