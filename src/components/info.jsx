                As a teenager, I was into fantasy novels, writing, coding, and
                hanging with friends. Starting college, I studied engineering
                before switching to literature and philosophy, both of which I
                still have a deep affinity for.{" "}

                Since then, I've taught writing and research classes at various
                NC colleges. I've also studied and worked as an outdoor guide at
                a contemplative center and as an operations manager at a
                wildcrafting & outdoor school.

                These days, I spend most of my time exploring software / web
                development. I appreciate the way this work integrates my past
                interests yet allows for new forms of expression, collaboration,
                and community.{" "}
