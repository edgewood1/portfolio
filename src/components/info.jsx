                In college, I studied literature and philosophy and spent many
                years teaching college writing and research classes at various
                nearby colleges.

                I've also spent several years as an outdoor guide for teens as
                well as an operations manager at a wildcrafting & outdoor
                school.

                In terms of coding, it's easy for me to see it as an extension
                of the various forms of writing I've explored through my life.
                To this end, I appreciate the way web development integrates my
                past interests yet allows for new forms of expression,
                collaboration, and community.
